          <h3>Goals</h3>
          <div class="BodySection">
            <ul>
              <p>The goals of this project are primarily to give the team members a significant amount of experience with system design and implementation that can be used in real world situations, and secondarily to provide a meaningful quality system that can be used in the real world.</p>
              <li>Develop a product to simulate a single baseball game, an entire regular season, and the playoffs</li>
              <li>Greatly enhance and expand the knowledge of the development team</li>
              <li>Provide an interface to allow web applications, mobile apps, and 3rd parties to interact with the simulator</li>
            </ul>
          </div>      
            <h3>Description</h3>
            <div class="BodySection">
              <p style="font-weight:bold;">Simulation</p>
              <p>The completed system will simulate at bats based on a statistical probability model. The following statistics will be used to calculate the results. The exact forumlas have yet to be developed, but I am confident that this will be a minor task.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>The number of hits allowed, walks, and strikeouts for a pitcher</li>
                <li>The propertion of hits, doubles, triples, and home runs to outs for a batter</li>
              </ul>
              <p style="font-weight:bold">Dynamic Decisions</p>
              <p>The final version of the system will also include components for data mining and artificial intelligence to make the simulator more dynamic. In the final version, the system will support the following features:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>The ability to decide when a team should go to the bullpen</li>
                <li>The ability to determine when to use a pinch hitter based on the current situation</li>
                <li>The ability to calculate effective pitching and batting stats by analyzing recent and historical performances</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
          </div>
<h3>Limitations and Assumptions</h3>
<div class="BodySection">
  <p>This is is a simulator, it can never be precise enough to model human behavoir, but nonethless it can point you in the right direction. The following are major assumptions this project is based on:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The simulator is governed by chance, therefore there are no biased decisions one way or another so the system accurately describes the <span style="font-style:italic">probabile outcome</span></li>
    <li>Long term statistics of a player are useful, but using short term statistics is more realistic</li>
    <li>The common trends of hitters and pitchers over time are useful in calculating effective batting and pitching probabilities</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<h3>Schedule</h3>
          <div class="BodySection">
            <p>Scheduling is the major constraint for this project. The project will be worked on for short bursts of three months and sit idle for 4 to 6 months before being worked on again. The work will be broken down into 3 major versions:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Develop a basic simulator system, Due: 8/24/2012</li>
              <li>Develop a web application that can interact with the simulator, Due 1/18/2013</li>
              <li>Develop a mobile application that can interact with the simulator, Due 6/7/2013</li>
            </ol>
          </div>
          <h3>Development Platforms and Technologies</h3>
          <div class="BodySection">
            <p>The system will use some servers that run on a variant of the UNIX operating system and others that run Microsoft. The following shows what combination of platforms, programming languages, and technologies will be used for which components:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>A Server running on UNIX will support the main simulator component written in C</li>
              <li>A server running on Microsoft will host a web application built using ASP.NET Model View Controller and Windows Communication Foundation</li>
              <li>The mobile application will be built for Android OS Version 2.3.3</li>
            </ul>
